# Instructions
To run the game on mac or linux, please download the introgame file. 
Note: This currently doesn't work on Windows as it is a bash file, we look to implement that in future.
Run the command chmod +x introgame to make the game an executable.
Then, use ./introgame to run it.

Have fun!
